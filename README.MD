## What is this?

This is a distributed job runner for .NET Standard 2.0 Applications.

Inspired by Celery for Python, it allows you to quickly queue code execution on a worker pool.

- Use natural expression syntax to queue jobs for execution.

- Queued jobs are persisted, and automatically run by the first available worker.

- Scale your worker pool by simply adding new nodes.

- Backed by Redis, all tasks are persistent.

## A Minimal Example

```c#
public static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    var redisConnectionString = "127.0.0.1:6379";

    var taskQueue = TaskQueue.Redis(redisConnectionString);
    
    await taskQueue.Enqueue(() => Console.WriteLine("echo"));
    await taskQueue.ExecuteNext();
}
```
